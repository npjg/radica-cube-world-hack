This is an ongoing effort to dump the ROMs of Radica Cube World cubes. I am currently just understanding how the 
inter-cube communication works, and later I will see if that provides any useful insights into electronically extracting the ROMs.

 - A [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/pikfko/has_anyone_considered_emulation_for_cube_world/) with discussion from MAME. Apparently they have decapped these, but I have not been able to obtain die shots.
 - An [initial Stack Overflow question](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/660286/identifying-mcu-communication-protocol-in-low-power-toy) about the protocol.
